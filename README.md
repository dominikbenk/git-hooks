#### What are git hooks and why is it good to use them?
Git hooks are a handy tool that can boost our efficiency or make our collaboration with other colleagues a bit easier. They are basically executable scripts (those can be shell, Python or other scripts) located in *.git/hooks* folder that are triggered by classical git commands and executed in order to affect them the way we want.
